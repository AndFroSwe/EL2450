It is theoretically possible to have a controller that adjusts the robot
correctly if we are in continous time. Since we now are dealing with
descrete time it gets harder to adjust the robot perfectly. We would now
need some type of adjusting, non-uniform quantizer and sampler to get
the precision needed for our type of distances. This would have to
increse quantizing and sampling period the closer to $d_p[k]$ we would
get.

In reallity would this be very hard to do with all the disturbances that
exists in the real world implementation in the robot. The most likely
scenario would be a robot that oscillates around $d_p[k]=0$.
