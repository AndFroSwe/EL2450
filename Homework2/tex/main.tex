\section{Rate Monotonic scheduling}
\label{sec:rate_monotonic_scheduling}

\q %1
{
    Explain what Rate Monotonic scheduling means.
}
{
    Rate Monotonic scheduling means that all tasks are given a priority. At te
    beginning of each cycle, the task with the highest priority is run until
    Rate Monotonic scheduling means that all tasks are given a priority. At te
    beginning of each cycle, the task with the highest priority is run until
    completion.

\q %2
{
	Are the three tasks schedulable?
}
{
	Calculating the utilization factor U from 
	\begin{equation}
		U = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{C_i}{T_i}=\frac{6}{20} + \frac{6}{29} +
        \frac{6}{35} = 0.75
	\end{equation}	
	The rules states that if $U<1$ the set is schedulable.
}
\q %3
{
    What are the differences in control performance between the different
    pendulums?
}
{
    All pendulums are asymptotically stable and have similar control
    performance. The performance is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:T3_dmperformance}.

}
\q %4
{
    Compare against the schedule in the model. Does it match?
}
{
    As can be seen below in Figure~\ref{fig:Task_4_sch_6ms}, the schedules
    match. The tasks are schedulable as stated in q2.
