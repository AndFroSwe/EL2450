\q
{
    A gain named Tap exists in the Tank 1 model, what is its function?}
{
    The gain Tap models the openable tap on the upper tank. The value 0 means that it is currently closed. A value of 1 means fully opened.
}
\q
{
    Place the poles to give a following step resonse:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rise time less than 6s
        \item Overshoot less than 35\%
        \item Settling-time less than 30s
    \end{itemize}
}
{
    With the parameters set to $\chi=0.5$, $\omega_0=0.2$ and $\xi=0.7$ yields
    a system with risetime of 3.31 s and a settling time 18.8 s and an overshoot
    of 22.6\%.
}
\q
{
    What does the reference signal look like?
}
{
    The signal starts at 40 and recieves a step by 10 at 100 s which sets it to
    50.
